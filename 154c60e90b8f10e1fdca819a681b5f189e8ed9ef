Any update as to when this could be implemented?

@railto This will be released by the end of the month, some cleanup needed.

@chalasr - Can't wait for this to be implemented. It'll be easier to deploy with docker thanks to this PR. No more volume to store only the keys...
Thanks for your work !

Sorry for being latish guys, this is ready and will be merged today (not now in case one wants to give it a last review).
