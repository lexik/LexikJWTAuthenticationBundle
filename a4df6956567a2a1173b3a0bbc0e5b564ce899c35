Would you mind double-checking there is no more similar issues please?

@chalasr Found an another.
I ran throught the code with PHP 7.2 (min version for Symfony 5.4).
#1041 and #1167 introduced the incompatibilities.

I have no idea why the checks were green for PHP 7.2 and Symfony 5.4

@fracsi Good question, it seems that build is totally broken despite it doesn't show up as such!

Gonna look into this asap.
