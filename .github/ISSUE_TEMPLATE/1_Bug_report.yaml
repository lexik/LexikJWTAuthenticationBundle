        ‚ö†Ô∏è  This is the most important part of the report ‚ö†Ô∏è
        Without a way to easily reproduce your issue, there is little chance we will be able to help you and work on a fix.
        Please, take the time to show us some code and/or config that is needed for others to reproduce the problem easily.
        Most of the time, creating a "bug reproducer" is the best way to help us and increases the chances someone
        will have a look at it.
