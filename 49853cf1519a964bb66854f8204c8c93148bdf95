Looks good to me. I'll merge this very soon and send a follow-up PR to remove the whole security-guard integration.

@chalasr any idea when i can expect this to be merged (and tagged in 3.x)
Dont know if you still have other pulls/issues you want to merge into the 3.x branch

the [JWTRefreshTokenBundle Pull](https://github.com/markitosgv/JWTRefreshTokenBundle/pull/338) is merged already, and hopefully gets a tag soon.

after that this is the only thing that blocks our WMS upgrade to Symfony 6.1 and PHP 8.1. because we can't enable preloading because of the [original issue of this pull](https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle/issues/996)
