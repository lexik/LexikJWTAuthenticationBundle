Hi,

Even if I am not sure to be fully qualified for that, let try to review that wording.

From my POV, PHPSecLib and OpenSSL are cryptographic libraries, so `encryption_engine` is correct however `crypto_engine` should be more appropriate.

I noted some PHPDoc information to be updated accordingly or such as in [KeyLoaderInterface.php#L6](https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle/blob/2.0/Services/KeyLoader/KeyLoaderInterface.php#L6): Interface for classes that are able to load ~~SSL encryption~~ keys.

Anyway, method names are quite clear and should not be changed.

Would you have a suggestion of correction?  `"... load crypto keys"`?

Thank you @Spomky 👍
