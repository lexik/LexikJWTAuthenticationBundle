Contributing
============

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before
maintainers accept and merge your work.

You MUST follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/) and
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/). If you don't know about any of them, you
should really read the recommendations. Can't wait? Use the [PHP-CS-Fixer
tool](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/):

```
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --config-file=.php_cs
```

__Note:__ Never fix coding standards in some existing code as it makes code review more difficult.

You MUST run the test suite.

You MUST write (or update) unit tests.

You SHOULD write documentation.

Please, write [commit messages that make
sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
before submitting your Pull Request.

One may ask you to [squash your
commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want
commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).

Thank you!
