Thanks for the PR. Did you actually test it? I suspect this is not enough to properly support setting it via an env variable:

I tested successfully with my own application. Symfony DI automatically resolves the environment parameters when generating the DI factories. I assume this is the reason why environment variables already work for all the other config options.

Happy to provide a test, but couldn't find a good test to hook into or to copy from. There was no test provided when introducing #940 and couldn't really find a test that already utilizes environment variables for other config options.

Hi @chalasr, anything you'd want me to add to this PR to make this mergeable?
