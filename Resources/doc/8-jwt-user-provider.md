A database-less user provider
=============================

From [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/introduction):

> Self-contained: The payload contains all the required information about the user, avoiding the need to query the database more than once.
> https://jwt.io/introduction

A JWT is _self-contained_, meaning that we can trust into its payload for processing the authentication. 
In a nutshell, there should be no need for loading the user from the database when authenticating a JWT Token,  
the database should be hit only once for delivering the token. 

That's why we decided to provide an user provider which is able to create User instances from the JWT payload.

Configuring the user provider
-----------------------------

To work, the provider just needs a few lines of configuration:

```yaml
# app/config/security.yml
security:
    providers:
        jwt: 
            lexik_jwt: ~
```

What does it change?
--------------------

Now that the provider is configured, it will automatically be used by the `JWTGuardAuthenticator` at the time to authenticate a token.
Instead of loading the user from a "datastore" (i.e. memory or any database engine), a `JWTUserInterface` instance will be created from the JWT payload, will be cached for a request and be authenticated.
We provide a simple  `JWTUser` class implementing this interface, which is used by default when configuring the provider.

Can I use my own user class?
----------------------------

Of course, you can. You just need to make your user class implement the `JWTUserInterface` interface.
This interface contains only a `createFromPayload()` _named constructor_ which takes the user's username and 
the JWT token payload as arguments and returns an instance of the class.

##### Example of implementation

```php
namespace AppBundle\Security;

final class User implements JWTUserInterface
{
    // Your own logic
    
    public function __construct($username, array $roles, $email)
    {
        $this->username = $username;
        $this->roles = $roles;
        $this->email = $email;
    }
    
    public static function createFromPayload($username, array $payload)
    {
        return new self(
            $username,
            $payload['roles'] // Added by default
            $payload['email'] // Custom
        );
    }
}
```

_Note_:  You can extend the default `JWTUser` class if that fits your needs.

##### Configuration

```yaml
# app/config/security.yml
providers:
    # ...
    jwt:
        lexik_jwt:
            class: AppBundle\Security\User
```

And voil√†!
