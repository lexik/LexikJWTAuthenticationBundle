🙏 Thanks a lot for working on this!

Given the diff on the public API is quite small, I think we can afford the added typehints without releasing a new major.
About the `Response::setData(): static`, I fear we have to use the same `eval()` trick that you removed in `ForwardCompatTestCaseTrait`. Ok for you?

Yeah, that would probably work out best.  I can mess with that later on.
