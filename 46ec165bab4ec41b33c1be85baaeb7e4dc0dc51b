Could you also update the `LcobucciJWSProvider` class? I can do it otherwise.
Thanks for proposing this feature

I needed this for a project I'm working on, so why not share the implementation ðŸ˜„
I'll update the other provider class in the next days.

Finally had the time for it, also updated the corresponding tests.
