@chalasr A merge of the 2.x into the 3.x would be nice to start. I'll let you know afterwards

@maxhelias done in https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle/commit/3711d6fbe403606620c626dcb7211294fb1f776e

Thanks @chalasr !

It's difficult to fix the CI without cleaning the code base for symfony > 5.4. I can do it here and I can increase the compatibility with php too. Like  > 8.1 ? WDYT ?

Yes, please go ahead :) Requiring PHP 8.1+ and Symfony 6.2+ is fine to me
